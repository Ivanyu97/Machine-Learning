# Deep Learning Specialization
Deep Learning Specialization contains several coures taught by Andrew Ng at deeplearning.ai. Here is the notes of my understanding and efforts while learning the coures in the specialization. I really have havested a lot after taking the lectures. Thanks Prof. Andrew Ng. He is a really excellent teacher and researcher. And also thanks coursera providing me with the financial aid.

Overall, there are five courses in the Deep Learning Specialization, they are as follows:      
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning)       
- [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning)      
- [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning)        
- [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning)       
- [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)

Next is the notes of all the courses in details.
