This paper is the notes of Deep Learning Specialization at Coursera taught by Prof. Andrew Ng. There are five courses in this specialization. They are \textit{Neural Network and Deep Learning (NN Overview)}. \textit{Improving Deep Neural Networks : Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization (Optimization)}, \textit{Structuring Machine Learning Projects (NN-Projects)}, \textit{Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)} and \textit{Sequence Model (SNNs)}, respectively. 

Course \textit{NN Overview} mainly talks about the foundations of deep learning. It includes the major technology trends driving deep learning, the  building, training and applying of fully connected deep neural network, the vectorization technology improving network efficiency and the key parameters in a neural network's architecture. Course \textit{Optimization} represents the key rules to improve neural networks' performance. It includes the industry best-practices for building deep learning applications, and a variety of tricks about hyperparameter tuning, regularization and optimization. More information about the rest three courses will conclude here later.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
This note is heavily based on Prof. Andrew Ng's course at Coursera. Thanks Andrew for taking this wonderful course, I've learnt a lot from that. Besides, thanks Coursera for providing me full-funded financial aids to finish all the five courses in the specialization. Moreover, parts of the note are borrowed from Mahmoud Badry's github repository\footnote{https://github.com/mbadry1/DeepLearning.ai-Summary}. It gives me a clear panorama of what is the most important.
