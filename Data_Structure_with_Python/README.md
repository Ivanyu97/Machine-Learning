This is the review of data structure (concepts and usages) with python. Most of the information is based on [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html) and the corresponding non-official [github](https://github.com/facert/python-data-structure-cn). 

For the master of graphs and trees needs more practice, I will append more LeetCode solution to help the understanding of them, for which I have not present anything in the corresponding repos so far. I may extend sth on my own.
